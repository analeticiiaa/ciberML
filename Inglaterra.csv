Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_1;not only are we socialised from childhood to make ourselves smaller and other peoples lives easier, even the culture around us demonises characters who impose their desires on others. in romcoms, in particular, being a confident, direct woman is vilified, whether it is the forthright book editor Margaret Tate, played by Sandra Bullock, in the proposal or Sharpay Evans, portrayed by Ashley Tisdale, the sparkly pink diva in high school musical. for years, Amy Beecham, a stylist, was taught that the ultimate goal was being down to earth and low maintenance was the ultimate goal. now, she is discovering that being high maintenance is not the toxic trait we have been told it is.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_2;they call me picky and modern. at one point, i was even told by an aunt to just take the next one that comes. author Shubnumkhan has spent a lifetime fielding questions about why she does not have a partner. it is taught her that society is still uncomfortable with the idea of a woman being single and happy, she writes. ⁠
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_3;the number of women attending football matches in the united_kingdom continues to grow, at some games, women make up 25_percent of spectators, but can feel underrepresented and marginalised. this video piece profiles this fan girl,  a community empowering female football fans by capturing the faces, voices, stories and opinions of women who love the beautiful game
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_4;the, i go to work and you stay_at_home agreement, is a sham if even when the paid work stop, you are still expected to do all the domestic and reproductive_labour, for six children! men know in their hearts that even getting punch in the head is easier than this and more rewarding. otherwise, more men would be eager to be house husbands.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_5;there is a view that women have less value as they age, while older men become more attractive. in particular, misogynist corners of the internet, there is a myth that women hid the wall at 30 and just completely shrivel up. love island shows that the ridiculous idea that 30 is somehow old has filtered into the mainstream. if you think of the women in your lives, we all look pretty similar at 25, 30, and 35, not much changes! and even when we do change and age, so what, the patriarchy wants women to see aging as a personal failure, instead of a natural process, literal proof of a life lived. to see 30 as the sword of damocles, the absolute thing to fear. the women hitting the wall at thirty propaganda is, of course, a complete fairytale. it is a lie propagated to comfort the bitter men. they want to scare women into settling for whatever relationship they are in in their 20s. to settle for less. they want women to think that they are less worthy in their 30s and 40s, which also just so happen to be the ages when they are growing in confidence, financial security, experience, and wisdom. at the same time, men like to convince themselves that they are much more worthy as they age, so of course it is totally fine and not creepy when they are 50 years old hitting on women in their 20s. as women age, they become more themselves and take up more space, and that terrifies some men.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_6;happy women history month! throughout history, discoveries, inventions made by women have been overlooked or completely disregarded, by both the men who took credit for them and those who wrote the history books. when you consider the barriers and oppression these women had to overcome to gain the education, resources, time and access to the equipment needed for these discoveries, these omissions are even more egregious. the idea of one man revolutionising history through his special genius is a false narrative, created by men who wish to paint themselves that way. the story of discoveries and intervention is more often than not one of teams, teams building on the work of people that have gone before them, teams that include women, and benefit from the labour and work of women. also sometimes men just straight steal the work of women, they get away with it because the structural power is on their side. so let us give these incredible women to long overdue credit they deserve. even if we can not give them the nobels they deserve
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_7;when i was growing up, i felt excluded from skateparks and football pitches and traditionally male outdoor areas. when my friends and i went to the skatepark, we were told to leave on multiple occasions by boys. after a while we just stopped showing up. a recent study by the royal institute of british architects highlighted research that found 80_percent of the people who use outdoor spaces and equipment for young people are male. academics from the department of educational studies at goldsmiths university, gave evidence to the inquiry and said girls are not given the access to community spaces that boys are. and added that they feel they do not have a right to use skateparks, while often equipment is built with the default male user in mind, so the height of equipment is often set too high. i am learning how to skate in my late 20, and even i find this is still the case. i am trying to reclaim some of those spaces, and have been learning to skate for about a year and a half now. while things are definitely changing for the better, it seems they are not changing quickly enough. public space, and recreational spaces should be equal and accessible to all. it is incredibly sad that in 2024 girls still feel that they do not have access or are able to be in these spaces. these studies are also rarely inclusive of the experiences of gender non conforming and trans kids, who surely have an even tougher barriers to accessing these spaces. the charity make space for girls is trying to address and change this, but we need more investment funding and urgency into democratising and creating spaces that are not restricted by gender.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_8;if yesterday has highlighted anything, it is the grim reality of how dangerous male entitlement can be. the root cause of this is misogyny. it is patriarchy. it is sexism repackaged as being a better or real man, by toxic social_media influencers. it is social_media companies themselves allowing this content to be eaten up, unchallenged. it is an entire society that turns a blind eye to the cause of violence towards women and girls. none of these problems are new, they have just repeatedly been left to fester, morph and grow until we are at a place where a high profile public figure can come on live tv and make misogynistic remarks about a woman, and the next day lament the death of a 15 year old girl by a boy, and not see how those actions are connected. misogyny breeds violence. it is never just a comment, banter, a joke, it is a culture that enables women to be seen as less than men. as disposable, without agency. we did not need to have this horrific wake up call. it should not  take the violent death of a teenage girl for society to listen. misogyny should be treated with the same severity as any other form of terror and violence. this is not something women should have to put up with anymore.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_9;i had just started working as an administrator for a car dealership. as you can imagine, it was 90_percent male and lad culture was rife. the daily remarks on my appearance ranged from run of the mill compliments, for example, you look nice to the graphic, that is, speculating about how i would be in bed, commenting on my figure in lewd detail, in short they began to wear thin very quickly. one day, i was on my lunch break and stood outside in the staff car park which was in the back. i was on the phone to my boyfriend, pacing between two cars as we chatted and then i paused to rest. out of nowhere, i felt an aggressive squeeze on my bum, i turned around and one of the drivers, who was weeks away from his retirement, just smiled and winked at me. i was so shocked that the only words i could seem to say were i am on the phone to my boyfriend! he walked off to the garage without a word or an apology. i reported it to my line manager straight away, he told me this would get really ugly for me and advised me to let it go. his boss, who was on holiday when the incident took place, told me he had expected me to have a sense of humour about the whole thing and said do not be so dramatic. i quit the next day.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_10;in 2023, a year that has already brought to light so many horrific abuses of women and girls, we have now been served yet another reminder that there are still people out there who refuse to treat us with basic respect and dignity.⁠ following a now viral on air misogynistic rant, controversial gb news presenter and political activist Laurence Fox has been formally suspended by the channel after he refused to apologise for asking who would want to shag that? about a female journalist live on air.⁠ this kind of casual misogyny is not  just repulsive playground talk. according to Amy Beecham from stylist, this poses a serious threat to the safety of women. why is it that i would not sleep with you is still considered the ultimate insult for women?
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_11;for most couples, date night is something to look forward to, but just over a year into my relationship with my ex partner, the prospect filled me with dread. i knew that once we would finished getting ready for a night out together, i would be greeted by a sullen face and endless shaming comments about my fashion and beauty choices, which he insisted were designed to command attention from other men. Jonah Hill and Darius Daulton Jackson have come under scrutiny for allegedly trying to control how their female partners present themselves.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_12;Brinta Ponnuthurai, known online as Brynta Ponn, has racked up more than 100,000 followers on Instagram thanks to her message of body_confidence, but that self_esteem was not always present. growing up as a south asian girl in toronto, canada, she faced judgment for her skin, which led to her experiencing deep hatred and resentment towards her appearance. through a process of unlearning the toxic messages we are told about our skin, practising gentleness and refusing to hide away, she worked her way from self hatred to absolute self love.⁠ we chatted with the influencer about her journey to skin freedom.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_13;why are women expected to dress sexy while men are not? because how we understand sexy in our culture is all about the male_gaze. in a patriarchal culture, failing to meet the male_gaze, demonstrating sexual agency as a woman, or not conforming to a narrow set of beauty standards are all met with sexist backlash. the sucess of women under the patriarchy is tied to how fuckable they are. woman can not simply opt out of this, no matter what choices individual women make about the way they dress or behave, the choices of women choices would still be limited by the desires of men. the way that women conduct themselves in a sexist society, even when problematic, is not worth critically analyzing without attention to the wider context of the patriarchical system we are trying to survive and thrive within.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_14;our society values physical attractiveness, but our cultural construction of femininity places a premium on beauty and body size, as an integral aspect of what is valuable.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_15;too fat. too thin. too tall. too small. too pale. too dark. too old. too wrinkly. too big. too little. too hairy. is not it all exhausting? imagine pouring all the energy it takes to hate yourself into creating some peace for yourself. imagine using that energy to change the world. not sure how long it will late but for now let us take a break.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_16;another week, another case of men publicly prescribing and shaming female sexuality. by now i am sure most of you would have seen or heard about the single wap  by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion, and probably the predictable backlash and distress it seems to have caused many cis straight men. funny how when a man talks about and sexualises a woman, it is ok, it is hot, it is  what we are programmed to see. but when a woman starts owning and reclaiming her sexuality, her body, and shock horror. talking in a sexual way, it is suddenly shameless and disappointing on a personal and moral level. why do we hold women in the media and popular culture to different standards than men? and also who the fuck cares. i am bored of the male_gaze, and i am wholly here for the roles reversing. from Ben Shapiro citing misinformation about the hygiene of women to Russel Brand mansplaining feminism, it shows how we are still very much living to the double standards and pitfalls of the patriarchy.⠀
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_17;no matter what you think about this kind of advertising, the bottom line is that there is a very blatant double standard in the censorship of fka twigs. the body of women, and specifically the colour bodies of women have been over sexualised and hyper sexualised for centuries. meaning that nudity equals sex or in this case? equals serious offence. there is a clear double standard here, with it is roots in sexism and racism
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_18;do you ever feel like no matter what you do, you are being sexualised? whatever you wear, whatever your job is, whatever you eat, you drink, however you live your life as a woman or marginalised person, it can be twisted a certain way? well, you are not alone.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_19;last week, the Angiolini inquiry report into the circumstances that led to the murder of Sarah Everard,  was published, concluding that Wayne Couzens should never have been a police officer, as her family insisted that Sarah died because he was a police officer, she would never have got into a car of a stranger.⁠ now, the new documentary of bbc Sarah Everard: the search for justice, made in close collaboration with the Everard family, delves deeper into investigating her murder by the metropolitan police, looking at how this devastating crime unfolded and the impact that was felt across the country.⁠ Amy Beecham, writes how the documentary, is a harrowing but important reflection on the extent of violence_against_women and girls in our society.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_20;according to domestic_abuse charity refuge, one in three united_kingdom women have experienced online abuse or harassment. currently, the online safety bill, which includes protections against cyberflashing and deepfakes, is on its way through parliament in a bid to change the murky laws around the way perpetrators can be prosecuted for digital crimes.⁠ in her new bbc documentary asking for it? actor and comedian Emily Atack reveals her own experience of online sexual_harassment, which ranges from explicit images to rape threats, all while wrestling with the harmful internal narrative that it is somehow her fault. ⁠i noticed, particularly in lockdown, that there was a huge rise in the amount of dick pics i was being sent, she says. my whole life i have kind of struggled with male_behaviour towards me, but this was something even more intense. when i am being sent videos and sexually_violent language, i am being sexually_harassed every single day of my life, at home, with my phone in my hands.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_21;on a historic night that should have been about what women can do, not what they look like, singer Becky Hill was the victim of body_shaming trolls.⁠ i am also sorry you think that what i was wearing devalued my talent and wanted me to be more covered up to be a role model for body_confidence to young women. as you can read, that is an oxymoron, she said.⁠ Hill described her final show performance as one of the biggest moments of my career, adding that she will remember that moment until the day she die.⁠ it was an absolute honour to open up such an iconic and a historic moment for women in football, and perform in all my popstar glory.⁠
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_22;as someone who is 5,8 i have experienced rejection from men due to my height plenty of times, I have in the past wished i was shorter so more men would see me as dating potential. i have never been particularly concerned about the height of men myself but when i have dated men a couple of inches shorter than me, i have noticed how odd people think it is. people make all kinds of judgements about relationships and the gender of people roles based on the height people. i have certainly found myself doing like princess Diana and trying to shrink myself around men who are shorter than me. my current boyfriend is the same height as me and i think it is great being able to see eye to eye with no neck straining. height preferences in dating is so common and so normalised, especially in heterosexual relationships, and like other preferences it is worth considering where it comes from: do you feel uncomfortablely big around men who are shorter than you, like you are taking up too much space or taking on a more masculine role? do you see taller men as being more masculine or more of a protector or more of a man? no one is forcing anyone to dating someone they do not want to, it is just always worth in life considering where your desires come from and if they are really as innate as we tend to think they are.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_23;it feels weird posting this because 32 really is not that old, but a 28 year old went viral on tiktok with a similar video where loads of teenagers were freaking out about ageing in the comments. when you are a woman, you are either too young or too old. you are expected to hate your skin, hate any changes, and hate any sign of ageing, even though ageing is an inevitable part of life. i have so many memories of women in my life telling me how lucky i have to have young skin and tearing themselves apart. i do not want to feel that way, i want to feel neutral and be able to enjoy and live my life, free from the fear that my skin might not fit a certain ideal. demonising ageing is one of the many ways the patriarchy keeps women in their place, the more wisdom and experience you gain, the less valuable and worthy you are. it divides women into categories and pushing them into living in fear of the passage of time. it pushes women to spend time, money, and energy agonising over their skin. women fear ageing for good reason. older women face economic and social discrimination. women who do not wear makeup face economic and social consequences. women who do not fit into the narrow ideals of patriarchy face discrimination and violence.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_24;one of my earliest baby feminist memories is being interrupted by my grandmother while playing and asked to go help with set up for dinner in the kitchen, when i pointed out that my older brother have not been asked, just me and my sisters, i was told to stop being difficult. you better believe i dragged my brother into that kitchen so fast. to his credit, he also realises how unfair that was and is raising his son different.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_25;i was working in a busy emergency department, when a man came in who was caring for his brother with learning difficulties. the man with learning difficulties was in a terrible state, and clearly had not been cared for properly as his clothes were soiled and he had dried faeces on his legs. i asked the brother to step out so i could complete personal care for the man, but he refused stating, he does not need privacy. i asked the man with learning difficulties if he was comfortable with his brother staying, and he said he was. i began to undress the man, and when i bent over to pick up a towel from the floor the brother said, you are giving me ideas, bending over like that. i have always had a thing for nurses. i told the man how inappropriate his comment was, but he still refused to leave the room. i continued with personal care, and although no further comments were made, i felt intimidated and frighted, and i could feel his eyes on me the whole time. i told a senior member of staff about the incident and they simply said, unfortunately it is just one of those things. it happened less than a year into being a qualified nurse.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_26;as a postwoman, i get catcalled and shouted at by workmen most days of my working week. some weeks it is every single day. it got to the point at the beginning of this year where i was having to fight off panic attacks whenever i was delivering to houses having work done. i would feel my gut twist as work vans past me, anticipating the shouts, leers and invasive comments about my body. last week a middle age man was parked across the driveway of a house i was delivering to, he leaned out of his window and said, girl, you need to stop moving so fast, your body is making me sweat. i avoided the house for the rest of the week. i felt embarrassed, uncomfortable, and in light of the recent news regarding Sarah Everard and the outpouring of stories from women who have experienced harassment and violence at the hands of men, i now feel scared and unsafe. i smile and carry on walking, even though smiling at them is the last thing i want to do. if i do not respond i get shouted at more, or laughed at, so smiling is just the easiest option. i am tired of being treated like this just for being a woman. like my male colleagues. i am literally just trying to work, trying to pay my bills.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_27;this morning i did an interview with lbc radio about the death of seduction stemming from the ban of the song baby it is cold outside. where i was repeatedly asked, how many times can a man ask a woman to stay over after her saying no. and the bottom line of the question being, can not men seduce women anymore? firstly, how many times do women need to say no before they are listened to? and honestly, if a woman really wanted to stay the night, you would not have to ask her 5 times. there is this myth that has been repeatedly told to us in films and music, which is if you ask a woman enough, eventually she will just give in and say yes. my question is this, how seductive is it really, if the woman is repeatedly saying no?
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_28;speaking about the column written by Jeremy Clarkson, prince Harry said: what he said was horrific, and it is hurtful and cruel towards my wife, but it also encourages other people around the united_kingdom and around the world, men particularly, to think it is acceptable to treat women that way. to use the words of my stepmother, there is a global pandemic of violence_against_women. ⁠the sun said sorry, but what for? a spokesperson for Harry and Meghan said the statement was a public relations stunt and that the sun had not reached out to Meghan. the sun mentioned the strong response to Clarkson column, but made no mention of the actual impact of what he called a clumsy reference. it is difficult to take an apology as sincere when the body issuing it will not say exactly what it is for. ⁠how can we start to unpick the deeply woven culture of anger, hatred and violence towards women if we do not acknowledge the impact of these seemingly less serious moments? how can we make women feel safer when we let things slide? ⁠
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_29;i have, in my time, attracted a fair few frenemies, both men and women. they have varied widely in terms of background and character, but the one common feature is that they made me feel being their friend was a precious and unparalleled gift,  the equivalent of the toxic partner who tells you that you will never find anyone who loves you like i do. it takes years of recovery to realise you will not, and that this is a good thing because the way they loved you was unhealthy and controlling and not a little narcissistic.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_30;running is a way for people to take control in a way they perhaps can not with their love life and careers. you are not relying on someone else, or something external. you can work towards a milestone, build a habit and see the fruits of your labour very quickly. running is booming among women in their 20s and 30s, and it is easy to see why. when traditional milestones like marriage, motherhood and property feel out of reach, signing up for a half marathon satisfies our need for achievement.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_31;many people will think to themselves well I would leave him if he spoke to me like that. but that is why love bombing is a key stage of the pattern of emotional abuse. love bombing is characterised by excessive attention, admiration, and affection with the goal to make the recipient feel dependent and obligated to that person. it is a manipulative_tactic. it makes you feel special, needed, loved, valuable, and worthy, which are all the components that contribute to and increase a persons self_esteem. in the love bomber stage, everything seems perfect. you have all the validation and affirmation you have ever wanted. but then, after the love bomber has gained your trust, the switch happens, and behaviour like this emerges. the conning,manipulation, and abuse begin. like a switch, this person who once made you feel like so good starts to belittle, control, and devalue you. and because you had a taste of how it could be in the love bombing stage, you are more willing to give them leeway and make excuses. you think well if I am just less annoying, he will return to the lovely man I first met. they do not return except temporarily, it only gets worse. victims of this behaviour will often feel very confused and mentally all over the place. this is by the perpetrators design. it is never your fault.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_32;there is typically an escalation in abusive_behaviours as the abusive_partner becomes comfortable with abuse, know they can push the boundaries and often as a considered response to increase or maintain control over the other person. many people dismiss acts like punching a wall as well I did not hurt anyone so it does not count or even well I did not hurt anyone so it is a good action because they see it as releasing their anger without punching a person. many people dismiss it as men just being out of control or even as a healthy expression of anger because boys will be boys. if someone genuinely can not help themselves from smashing stuff when they are angry, they need anger management therapy. punching a wall is violent and it is a huge red_flag, one you should run from. destroying your belongings shows a desire to hurt you. domestic_violence is born from small changes in already violent_acts. abusive words and threats escalate, smashing stuff escalates, pushing escalates, and punching escalates. femicide does not happen out of nowhere. smashing things is listed as a type of domestic_violence by the national domestic_violence hotline for a reason.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_33;in relationships, both partners should support the other to learn and grow, but too many men are entering adulthood and entering romantic_relationships without the basic skills needed for successful healthy_relationships. this fails men, and it fails the women who have to put in the labour, energy, and patience needed to make their relationship with this man that they love work. in times gone by, this dynamic was not challenged. women were told not to expect much emotional_support from their partners and to just be happy with that. after all, you did not have much choice. but now we expect relationships full of love and connections, we deserve those relationships, and for that to be possible, the skills of emotional intelligence, communication, empathy, and listening are needed. women who, from a young age, are expected to learn these skills, are more likely to enter into adult romantic_relationships already equipped with them, men are not. but these skills are not inherent, they can be learnt. men are perfectly capable of learning them themselves and not putting all that emotional_labour onto their current or future partners. because love only goes so far, women will not be sticking around to grow a man anymore. we expect them to be fully grown.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_34;as someone who was in a relationship with a man 10 years senior in my early 20s, much of this case for marrying an older man reads like a list of red_flag.the first one that really hit home, was the describing of an other half not as a partner, but as my mentor, lover, and in only certain contexts, my friend. when my relationship ended, something I had told myself throughout was that he was more of a mentor to me than a partner. the problem with this was, with a 10 year age, earnings and work experience gap, there was a huge power imbalance. yet one of the most obvious things in this article is the security and romance the author writes about does not come from an age gap, it comes from a wealth gap, which makes it read like a modern version of a 1950s housewife manual for finding a good husband.  I am aware we are in the midst of a cultural pivot back to traditional values, anti feminism, the stay_at_home girlfriend and tradwives. did these ever really leave? and I am not going to sit here and tell people to not marry rich or work, women should be able to do what they want. however there is a more pressing case to be made for looking out for signs of coercive, emotional and financial control. according to surviving economic abuse: 1 in 6 women in the united_kingdom experience financial_abuse in a current or former relationship. 95_percent of women who experience abuse report experiencing financial_abuse. more than half of women experiencing domestic_abuse said they had no money so could not leave. this is a grim reality for countless women and worth mentioning if we are having the marrying rich convo. I live in an apartment whose rent he pays and that shapes the freedom with which I can ever be angry with him. I am sure there are many benefits to marrying rich, but at what cost?  when the house of cards is built on youth, beauty and mentorship, what happens when we grow up, our bodies change, or we eventually want a career or financial_freedom? i fear this article does not make a case for marrying older, it makes a case for finding financial_independence and a partner who does not treat you like a pet.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_35;to celebrate valentines we want to reminisce over some of the worst toxic_relationship ideals we have been fed in films about how romance or acts of love are supposed to look. despite their sins, I do have a soft spot for basically all of these movies. but i think that is just my unshakable nostalgia. either way, rewatching them is a wild experience! this is very much a non exhaustive list so please add more and let us know what you think in the comments.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_36;he bludgeoned his heavily pregnant wife to death, but sure, he sounds like a gentle golden retriever kinda man. when will we stop glorifying and humanising men who murder their wives and entire families? it is entirely unhelpful, and feeds into already dangerously prominent myths about abusive_relationships and how they present.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_37;women are publicly and privately shamed on what feels like an hourly basis if they do not adhere to societal_expectations around motherhood. Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas have filed for divorce, and the conversations around this particular celebrity breakup have been harsh, shaming and undoubtedly sexist.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_38;more than half of working_mothers have experienced some form of discrimination, either during their pregnancy, maternity_leave or upon their return to the workplace.⁠ the charity, which aims to eradicate the motherhood penalty, teamed up with women in data to survey more than 24,000 parents, uncovering the workplace discrimination that women face after becoming mothers.⁠
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_39;it is expected that women have some sort of instinctive desire to have children and somehow also know how to take care of them, regardless of needs, wants, or experience due to maternal_instinct. and while wanting to have children and take care of them is great, the idea that just because you are a woman you should instinctively know what to do with them is unrealistic and adds a whole lot of unnecessary anxiety and stress. on the flip side, it is expected that men will be useless with all children including their own and that they will not be the primary caregiver, that is why it is daddy daycare and I hope he will be ok left alone with the baby. it leads to men who exhibit any kind of child care skills being highly praised.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_40;well done Paige for rejecting the mother_role so many men put women into in relationships! the mother_role  is forced on women who have immature, lazy and or emotionally stunted male partners. within femininity motherly characteristics are put on a pedestal: tolerance, gentleness, caring, nurturing, sensitivity, nurturance, deference. these can be wonderful qualities but not when they enable men to take advance of women. mothers are always supposed to put everyone else first, they are not to be selfish or demanding or aggressive. women in this role are responsible for doing all the emotional_labour and often domestic_labour in heterosexual relationships, constantly working on things like communication and connectivity. reinforcing the idea that a good girlfriend or wife is one that constantly tries to fix a man is not only gross but harmful. it teaches women that it is their duty to not only accept male_behaviour that is unacceptable but to take on responsibility for it, responsibility that should be on the mans shoulders.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_41;more and more women are unsure if they want children or sure that they do not and some people just can not get their heads around it. so many people just assume that all women are desperate for child because is not that the whole point of women?! but it is more common for women to be unsure than men. a poll from 2013 found that more than 80_percent of men said they would always wanted to be a father or at least thought they would be someday. just 70_percent of women felt the same. is it any wonder when women are asked to sacrifice so much to be mothers? our health, our careers, our unpaid_labour. society does not support mothers, it would much rather shame women who choose to opt out.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_42;the campaign to get misogyny recognised as a hate_crime has been a long one, but now women in england and Wales are being asked to share their experiences of gender_based harassment, assault and abuse. by submitting your own stories, you could help shape future government policy on misogynistic hate_crime.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_43;Roe v Wade has been overturned. we are outraged and heartbroken for the women of usa. the supreme courts ruling is more than a life changing regression on reproductive_rights, it threatens the foundations of equality, the autonomy women have to make decisions about our own bodies and lives. abortion rights must be entrenched in law because abortion rights are human_rights. and today is ruling for women in the usa is a harsh snapshot of what many women around the world fear, and of course which many must already endure.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_44;many black and brown women will see their own experiences reflected in how women member of parliaments are treated, tone policed, silenced and spoken for. in the midst of dealing with racist comments from a conservative_party political donor, member of parliament Diane Abbott attended the questions of the prime minister today only to be ignored repeatedly by the speaker of the house while others debated her own experiences around her.⁠
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_45;what does it mean to be a wife? women are just as capable as men of internalising patriarchal ideas about women and their role in relationships. in our society, the meaning of and history of marriage is so deeply rooted in patriarchy and gender_inequality, that when these women talk about being a wife they imagine it as a role that serves a husband through domestic_labour and sexual_labour, rather than as a partnership between two equals. the patriarchy tells women that they exist to serve others, that they must prove that they can do this by being hot, by doing unpaid domestic_labour, by being good at sex, even by getting an education, in order to be worthy of marriage and worthy of the role of wife.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_46;the patriarchical myth of men as protecters and providers is designed to keep women scared and compliant by pretending that they benefit from the patriarchy. but it is a narrative that refuses to accept the reality of male_violence_against_women, that it is mostly perpetrated by men close to women, in favour of stroking mens egos and fantasies about beating up foreign invaders to protect their property: their woman. anyone of any gender who wants to protect in a meaningful way should do so by working to deconstruct the white supremacy patriarchical structures that excuse, enable, and encourage violence against marginalised groups.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_47;women do not exist for men. that should be pretty simple to understand, yet not for some men. some men actually think women should shape themselves to their every desire, that we are not human beings with our own interests and hobbies. this kind of thinking can get in our heads if we are not careful, how many of us are guilty of changing our personalities to date someone you really like? of pouring yourself into someone until you are not sure who you are? it is nice to share interests with your partner but a man who thinks what you are interested in is silly or frivolous, nah. have you ever noticed that it is all hobbies that are dominated by women that are seen are silly and shallow? hobbies that are code as male, fishing, lifting weights, playing call of duty, watching sport, are seen as hobbies of importance, while hobbies that are code as female, practicing yoga, applying makeup, knitting, watching reality tv, are seen as inferior, some men do not even think women have hobbies. it is all part of the systematic devaluation of femininity, and a need of the patriarchy to keep women from discovering their own space and identity separate from men.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_48;one the largest conservative_party donors, Frank Hester made racist, violent and misogynistic comments about labour, member of parliament Dianne Abbot in 2019. while Hester claims they were rude, he completely failed to acknowledge the extreme, hateful misogynoir in these remarks. so what exactly is misogynoir? as you might know, misogyny is an extreme form of sexism, defined as the hatred of women. misogynoir is a term coined by the queer black feminist Moya Bailey in 2010, referring to a specific form of sexism, rooted in racism. the term blends concepts that combine misogyny and the french word for black, noir. the concept was also notably introduced by Sojourner Truth, who spoke out about misogynoir before the term was coined in her aint I a woman speech at the womens convention in 1851. There are plenty of ways that misogynoir manifests in real life and sadly, these absolutely vile and shameful comments from conservative_party donor Frank Hester are an example of exactly that.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_49;the conviction rates in this country speak alone to the fact that this government does not think rape is a crime. but literally not including it or harassment and stalking for that matter in the stats so you can announce a reduction in crime? madness!! it is no surprise a recent study from child protective service shows that half of 18 to 24 year olds are confused about consent, and believe that rape is only a crime if the victim fights back. the messaging from our government about gender_based violence has always been piss poor or non existent and now they are quite literally erasing sexual_assault as a crime to fit their narrative. this has to stop!!!! only slightly more depressing is the fact that x twitter fact checked this announcement from the conservative_party, to say that they had not included fraud and cyber crime in the report. so sexual_assault still does not register as a crime to anyone it seems. we need the government to fund mandatory education and awareness campaigns around this issue to counter the wave of misinformation young people face online. in the wake of the reach toxic_mens rights influencers have, we need to put up just as much of a fight to tackle it. we have an unbelievably high mountain of misinformation to climb still, this many years later. and I will not stop talking about it until everyone is paying attention.

Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_56;many of you might remember that I attended a married at first sight event hosted by the show where, during the questions and answers, I called out Brads behaviour and asked them why they continued to put abusers on the show, I mention George from last season too. I was shut down with they are maybe moving too fast. we saw it for what it was. one of my aims is to make the world a lot less comfortable for abusers, while also showing that they are not evil monsters, they are people we know. I want to give people the tools needed to call out this behaviour, to call it unacceptable. many people, either due to their own experiences or knowledge, are able to identify emotional_ abuse when they see it. that does not mean it is easy to escape abusive_relationships or save your friends from abusive_relationships or identify the abusers in your life, but it can be a tool in your arsenal. some abusers are far more open, others are much better at playing the nice guy, but I want people to be able to see their friends being treat like Shona and understand the need for a girls night where they ask her if she is ok and needs any support. to have a mate like Brad and to understand the need to tell him that you will not stand for his behaviour and explain why. people in relationships deserve basic respect. no one should think that belittling and manipulation is something that someone who loves you will do. love bombing is a manipulative tactic designed to make the victim think later on that it will get better, if I just change in the way he wants me to, he will love me again. it will not get better, you deserve better, seek support to help you leave.

I do not want to put blame on the bystander. the blame lies with the perpetrator alone, however there are systems in play that regularly contribute to harm against women and marginalised genders. why was not this man apprehended after exposing himself, masturbating and chasing two women earlier that same morning?

Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_75;yesterday was the 3 year anniversary of the day serving officer Wayne Couzens abused his police powers, abducted, raped and murdered Sarah Everard. it is hard to fathom how the horror of what happened to Sarah could get any worse, but since Lady Elish Angiolini inquiry published last week, it appears the police had plenty of opportunities to stop Couzens from offending, yet the harrowing fact of the matter remains that they did not, time and time again. the true magnitude of failures in vetting and policing have come to light, and it lays bare what we already knew that the police did not take sexual_harassment seriously enough. Couzens was a repeat sex offender before he ever crossed paths with Sarah Everard, including nine indecent_exposure allegations, but somehow managed to evade any consequences and kept working as a police officer. indecent exposure or flashing can sometimes be brushed off as a joke,not that serious, or just some weirdo, and is rarely dealt with or acknowledged with the gravitas and seriousness it warrants. when society, authorities, people in positions of power and privilege ignore and dismiss the small stuff  it sends a message that that kind of behavior is okay, which allows for more serious forms of violence to escalate unchallenged. this is also known as the pyramid of sexual_violence, and is precisely why I have spent the past 7 years advocating around the awareness and combatting of everyday harassment and assault. when we ignore sexua_harassment, that includes indecent_exposure  we ignore misogyny, we ignore attitudes of sexism, we ignore women girls and marginalised genders feelings, safety and security. we also ignore a brewing problem of misogyny being left unchecked to evolve into sexual_violence. the police had many opportunities to stop Couzens, but they turned a blind eye. let this be the last time we have to remind the police that all forms of sexual_harassment are completely unacceptable and should never ever be tolerated, and  I can not believe I even have to say this sentence  especially by actual police officers.

Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_90;how to shut down the worst seduction technique ever invented! happy valentines everyone! without further ado, here are some great comebacks to negging...but quickly whats negging you ask? negging is a form of emotional_manipulation, in the form of a backhanded compliment , which is used to undermine diminish confidence of the person it is directed at in the belief that it will make them more receptive to your advances. the term was coined and prescribed by pickup artists, and popularized by the book rules of the game which im not going to give any more air time to  but thats the history! read Laura Bates men who hate women for more info. negging can be as simple and subtle as making a backhanded compliment, such as are not you beautiful? i would never have the courage to wear my hair like that. the misguided intention is that the put down will make you more vulnerable and wanting to seek the approval of the usually cis straight man negging you. and somehow straight men think this makes us want to sleep with them. but this is not just something that happens with strangers in bars or on the street, this kind of emotional_manipulation. abuse, can happen in relationships too. and its something to look out for! anyway here are just some of my favourite comebackswow, what an interesting thing to say out loud. can you explain that? i do not really get it.just a plain thank you with a nice big sarcastic smile. sorry can you repeat that a bit louder, i did not quite catch it. any of these responses will immediately undermine their undermining. lets firmly leave this manipulative_tactic in the bin, its not hot, cute or sexy and it makes anyone who uses it look like an abusive predator.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_91;no means no. it does not mean convince me. here is a collection of stories people have sent in recently about trying and fend off the unwanted advances of men, and when that goes wrong. here also, are some questions I would like to ask: why do you need a reason to leave me alone? why do we have to pretend to have a boyfriend for you to get the message? why can you not accept that I am not interested, not because I am taken, but because I am not interested? and also, why do I have to be someone else property for my position to be made clear? ⠀
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_92;everyday is a great day to be an active_bystander !! today I want to talk about bystander_intervention and share a post illustrated. when we talk about bystander_intervention, we often think of the most extreme version of this, something like a citizens arrest. but it does not have to always be that confrontational, in fact there are many ways you can show up for and advocate for a person who is being harassed. when it comes to some of these ways, you might hear people refer to the 5 ds. those are known as: direct, delegate, delay, distract, document. while some of the ones illustrated in this post are slightly different, the majority of the messaging is the same. however, I would like to caveat that I probably would not engage or encourage the 3rd option if you are a woman or marginalised person, this is probably something in my opinion, that only a person who holds a certain amount of privilege and has done an extensive risk assessment could get away with, even then it is definitely most risky option! I would be interested to hear others thoughts on this below. these directions are supposed to show you options for how you can engage, sometimes it is as little as asking someone if they are okay. remember, when doing so please be safe and consider the safety of others around you. however doing something, is better than doing nothing.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_93;when you tell people you are getting divorced at 31, the questions come thick and fast. why did you go through with it? did something awful happen? was he emotionally_abusive ? did you meet someone else? people want to pinpoint exactly what went wrong, maybe so they can scan their own horizons for red_flag. but the truth is, my husband was not awful, and neither was my relationship. it just was not enough. saying that out loud was like coming up for air.⁠ in our latest issue, content creator and campaigner Sasha Pallari tells stylist why getting divorced is the bravest thing she has ever done.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_94;when Anna was 33, she found out that her husband of two years was cheating on her. at first, the reason behind the breakdown of her marriage made her feel ashamed, but as divorce proceedings got underway, that shame gave way to anger. she was determined that people should know exactly what had happened. I told everyone what type of person he is, she says. he was an arse and the world should know what he did. Annas unapologetically combative approach stands in stark opposition to the picture of divorce that has often been painted by celebrities and non famous folk alike over the last decade. throughout the 2010s and into the 2020s, there has been a pervasive social expectation that, if couples can not do until death do us part, they should at the very least end things amicably. ⁠in an age of conscious uncoupling, a messy divorce can be frowned upon but what if there is something to be gained from releasing your rage?
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_95;if you put a time limit on love you risk choosing the wrong person just because you feel like it is time. you risk forcing yourself into a role that might not feel right with a person who might be wrong for you. I do not believe in the one, that is romcom nonsense just training women to put up with shitty behaviour from men. life is long and complicated, feeling pressure that you are running out of time to find love will only make you unhappy. some people find love young, some people find it old, some people find love once, some people find it many times over, some people are happy single. one thing is for sure, at 27 you have a lifetime left to find love in many ways and many places.

Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_98;for female surgeons, sexual_assault is distressingly routine. as a report published in the british journal of surgery recently showed, almost one in three of those working in the national health service has been sexually_assaulted in the past five years, including 11 instances of rape. nearly 90_percent of those surveyed said they had witnessed sexual_misconduct, over a third had been on the receiving end of sexual_banter, and 29_percent had experienced unwanted_physical_advances.⁠ revealing these grim statistics has been called surgerys the hashtag me_too moment. stylist speaks to female surgeons about their experiences, and how important it is for things to change.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_99;do you remember when we told women to fight sexism in the workplace with power poses? that ted talk has thankfully had its moment, but there are still variations on this that get repeated, girlboss tips telling women to not say just, to take ! out of their emails, to dress in a certain way, or speak a certain way. they are told to speak up and learn in! these tips claim to give women confidence and help them progess in their careers, and maybe for some individual women, they will be helpful. but, these tips are more likely to be at best useless and, at worst harmful. research shows that women who are seen as too assertive or not assertive enough are punished in the workplace. women have to trend a fine line between the two, an impossible task.  because women changing the behaviour can not fix an inequal_system. research shows that women are just as likely as men to ask for higher salaries, and men and women are equally likely to report avoiding negotiations if they feared it would hurt their relationship with their boss. but women are less like to get those raises when they ask. why do we think that is? devaluing feminine traits like being friendly, speaking softly, or standing in a particular way is not helpful in the long run. blaming womens lack of confidence or lack of assertiveness on why they are not in leadership is victim_blaming . individual women are up against systemic inequality and misogyny. that is why there are not enough women in leadership positions, that is why women are underpaid and overlooked. the only solution is a reimaging of power and leadership as a position for any gender and where feminine_behaviours are seen as just as valuable as masculine ones, think Jacinda Ardern. fix the system, not the women.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_100;⁣I rediscovered this video yesterday and the shameless outward and internalised_misogyny is rife. this  video is from two years ago, but it does not age well. in this video Kelsey Beth Crossley calmly and gently explains why she does not enjoy being told to smile by strange men on the tube, and she is interrupted about 10 times by both Andy West and the presenters. it is almost painful to rewatch. I was asked to comment on this at the time, because my work was credited in the byline of the piece. so I wrote an article for the i news about my feelings. I had never written an article before so I was extremely nervous about getting the words out, but if you are passionate and ahem angry enough, it just comes to you. I urge you to watch this video all the way through and see what we are dealing with here. I can not decide what my favourite line is, it is either feminist idiots or but have you tried being a man on twitter. gosh it is so hard. really hard.⠀
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_101;‼️ important !! sexual_harassment has a severe impact on women and marginalised genders mental_health. it causes anxiety, depression, trauma, and dictates how we make hundreds of tiny decisions throughout the entire day. it impacts every part of our lives, and it makes those tiny, what should be mundane, decisions feel huge. but when the thing causing this anxiety is your boss? not only that, but someone you live in a close proximity too? and your complaints or concerns are being ignored? I can not imagine how destructive and isolating the impact of that would have been. the harassment Jaysley Beck endured from her army boss should not under any circumstances be downplayed as a factor in what happened to her. and nor should the accountability of the army, these things do not happen in a vacuum. they happen because some men can and will abuse their positions of power. they happen because of patriarchy. they happen because of misogyny going unchecked, ignored and unchallenged. they happen because they have been allowed to happen. and what about women? well, women have been forced and socialised to make sure men do not feel rejected. to keep men happy. not wound their fragile egos. constantly appease and be polite as to not appear rude, for fear of repercussions. so we do not get treated aggressively. so we do not upset them. so we do not get called frigid. so we do not make a scene or cause a fuss. so we do not get killed. because an insecure man with a wounded ego can be a very dangerous thing. because we have been told that we are responsible for for mens feelings and actions. it is fucking exhausting. and it is fucking unfair. harassment ruins lives. it ruins opportunities for women and marginalised groups. it makes your world smaller. it has real life consequences, and it is fundamentally a symptom and an aggravating factor of gender_inequality. we will never be equal until we feel safe. rip Jaysley. sending so much support to your family and friends this should not have happened.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_102;did you know almost 2 to 3 women have been sexually_harassed at work? well, if you follow this page, you are probably not that surprised. a new study from the trades union congress has revealed that 2 to 3 women experience harassment, bullying or verbal_abuse at work and that most victims do not report for fear of not being believed, or wanting to damage future career prospects or work relationships. I am sorry, the hashtag me_too has gone too far. what?? just no! we have always needed more than just a hashtag or infographic to create meaningful actionable change, and make women and marginalised folk feel safer in public spaces, but these statistics are so depressing! it has been 5 years since metoo, and we are still living in a time where women are scared to speak out about being harassed for fear of losing their jobs. has much progress really been made? perhaps the awareness around me_too has meant more people can recognise acts of harassment for what they are, but has the culture on a whole changed enough? if looking at the business sector in this country is anything to go by, the recent allegations against the confederation of british industry really say it all. I had a look into the prevalence of workplace harassment when doing my photo series front line harassment, speaking to key workers during the time of the pandemic about their experiences being harassed at work. this was at a time where we were all clapping for carers and national health service workers, when at the same government was giving out pitiful pay rises. it sparked a huge conversation around workplace safety, harassment claims and how little women are appreciated in key worker roles. we know it is not just frontline workers who experience daily harassment, it is everyone else apparently too. or as the survey points out 62_percent of women age 25 to 34. these figures are unacceptable in a modern functioning society. women and people of marginalised genders will never truly be equal to men if we are constantly being tormented in our place of work, alongside all the other forms of discrimination we already face. how many more years is it going to take?
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_103;what do you think is a parents and a mothers responsibility when they have a son who is exhibiting abusive_behaviors ? I am always hesitate to talk about mothers when discussing abusive_men because it so quickly becomes how can we find a woman to blame? but equally teaching young boys, as a society, not just as parents, about respect, empathy and emotional regulation, is the key to the creation of men who have healthy_relationships . also after watching George convince all the other contestants and the experts, it is satisfying to see that his mum has him figured out. well mostly I would not say overprotective personally.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_104;I love watching women on tv support each other and hold their male family members to account. shake needed to hear this, for his own future happiness as well as Deeptis. i think part of love is telling people the truth. i am also glad she did not do what other people have done when Shake has asked for advice, which is dismiss the importance of sexual attraction. i do find it interesting that the mothers are always the ones taking the lead in these meet the parents shows. mothers are presumed to be the ones to take on the emotional_labour of discussing their childrens feelings with them, to be the most interested in their children getting married and to hold the keys to the fiancé entering the family.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_105;I find it interesting when cis men talk about wanting large families, especially single men. they very rarely acknowledge that they are talking about a woman they have not even met yet risking her life and her health to achieve this dream of his. men who have this dream are very unlikely to take on the burden of labour of a large family after the birth either. over the past half century, fathers in usa nearly tripled their child care time from 2.5 hours per week in 1965 to seven hours per week in 2011. But, over this period, womens parenting time too has increased, from 10 hours per week in 1965 to 14 hours per week in 2011. this pattern repeats in the united_kingdom. when considering time spent in child care plus time spent in housework and working for pay, the birth of a baby increased mothers  total workload by 21 hours per week. in contrast, fathers total workload increased by only 12.5 hours per week. this represents a 70_percent greater increase in workload for women compared to men. these differences cannot be explained away by differences in paid work hours or breastfeeding. with this in mind a man wanting a large family is not the same as a woman wanting one
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_106;It is hard to pinpoint exactly what the worst part of these cards are…I am torn between: the gross patriarchal  sexist messaging this sends to young boys about their sisters and mothers place in the world. the perpetuating of misogynistic tropes and harmful stereotypes about women, daughters and wives. overtones of normalising coercive_control and da.  and the depressing reality that these photoshoots were if not organised by, were signed off, approved and thought to be harmless holiday fun the woman in the family. any more to add to the list???

Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_110;the message is clear: womens acceptance into the business world is conditional on them looking and dressing a certain way. these women are expected to wear painful high heels, uncomfortable clothes, spend hours on their hair and makeup, as well as a lot of money, only then will lord sugar and his associates listen to their business plans. And do not pretend that this is nott gendered just because the men wear suits: it takes five minutes to put a suit on. the all female semi final introduction could have gone so many ways, and they choose this way, how regressive.
Inglaterra;*ing_cyber *legenda_111;throughout history, people, particularly women, from the upper classes would showcase their wealth through uncomfortable fashions, for example, heavy fabrics, items you need someone else to help you put on, or fashions that restrict your movement and therefore ability to work. anything that makes it harder to work, showcases that you don not need to work, you are too wealthy for that. especially for women, where class is a larger factor than men in how much work they were expected to perform. a lower class woman would have to earn money for the household as well as perform domestic_labour, a higher class woman could have servants or slaves perform domestic_labour and her restricted freedom would make her a trophy of her husbands wealth. in modern usa, the top 20_percent of americans owned 86_percent of the countrys wealth and the bottom 80_percent of the population owned 14_percent. americans have the highest financial_inequality  in the rich world and over the past 20 30 years americans have also experienced the greatest increase in financial_inequality  among rich nations. on selling sunset, they throw around numbers like 20 million without batting an eyelid, they are part of the wealthy elite created by hypercapitalism. no wonder they act like Marie Antoinette.

Every time I look at my phone things seem to be ramping up to new levels of chaos and government incompetence...and it is all starting to feel a bit much. i have seen a lot of people posting things like,  it is just one christmas it is fine and things will be better next year which is all well and good, and, hopefully, true for some people. but I also think it is important to allow yourself to have all the feelings, to sit in this moment and give yourself a break. it is okay to feel sad right now, to feel overwhelmed, to feel let down by our government, to feel angry and conflicted about everything going on. things will get better eventually, and not feel so doom and gloomy. that is something we can all look forward to for sure. but if you are having a hard time looking a bit further down the line, you are not alone. If you are not feeling super festive at the moment, that is very understandable. and If you need to lie under a blanket for a few days and hide from the world, i think we all need that too. ⠀

I am aware of how eye wateringly cheesy this all sounds, but I do not care. i am looking forward to next year. to whatever happens, even though there is still so much uncertainty, and at this particular moment in time, things are feeling stranger than ever. but as this year is closing out, I am sure we can all feel a little relief. fingers crossed 2021 is less of a shit show....
